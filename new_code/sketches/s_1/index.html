      "Immanuel Kant s theory of the imagination is one of the most enduring aspects of his philosophy, inspiring philosophers ranging from Hegel to Sellars, Heidegger to Strawson. The legacy of Kant s account is due, in part, to his *broad* conception of the imagination. In contrast to philosophers who construe the imagination as something that operates in fairly confines, e.g., just in acts of make-believe or visualization, Kant conceives of imagination as a more pervasive mental capaaty that contributes to the cognitive, aesthetic, and moral aspects of our lives. Though compelling, the breadth of Kant's account also poses a dbaiienge to readers: in what sense are the wide range of activities that Kant ascribes the imagination to be understood as exercises of a single capacity? Moreover, given that he and different types of imaginative activity, e.g., productive and reproductive, how are we to undemand the underlying unity of the imagination as Kant characterizes it?"

      "In light of these questions, before we can proceed to an analysis of the contribution Kant takes the imagination to make in cognition, aesthetics, and morality, respectively, we need to begin with a discussion of his basic conception of the imagination. To this end, it will be helpful to consider two passages in which Kant offers a more general definition of the imagination. In the first passage, which appears in the so-called “B edition of the Critique of Pure Reason 787), Kant claims, “Imagination [Einbildungskraft] is a faculty for representing an object even *without its presence* in intuition.
