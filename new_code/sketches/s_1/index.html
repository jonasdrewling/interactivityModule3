      "Immanuel Kant s theory of the imagination is one of the most enduring aspects of his philosophy, inspiring philosophers ranging from Hegel to Sellars, Heidegger to Strawson. The legacy of Kant s account is due, in part, to his *broad* conception of the imagination. In contrast to philosophers who construe the imagination as something that operates in fairly confines, e.g., just in acts of make-believe or visualization, Kant conceives of imagination as a more pervasive mental capaaty that contributes to the cognitive, aesthetic, and moral aspects of our lives. Though compelling, the breadth of Kant's account also poses a dbaiienge to readers: in what sense are the wide range of activities that Kant ascribes the imagination to be understood as exercises of a single capacity? Moreover, given that he and different types of imaginative activity, e.g., productive and reproductive, how are we to undemand the underlying unity of the imagination as Kant characterizes it?"

      "In light of these questions, before we can proceed to an analysis of the contribution Kant takes the imagination to make in cognition, aesthetics, and morality, respectively, we need to begin with a discussion of his basic conception of the imagination. To this end, it will be helpful to consider two passages in which Kant offers a more general definition of the imagination. In the first passage, which appears in the so-called “B edition of the Critique of Pure Reason 787), Kant claims, “Imagination [Einbildungskraft] is a faculty for representing an object even *without its presence* in intuition.

      As this definition suggests, Kant conceives of the imagination as a faculty of representation, more specifically, a faculty that is responsible for intuitive, i.e., sensible representations of objects that are not immediately present to us. This often happens when we imagine a physical object or property of an object that is no long present to us, e.g., when I imagine a Frank Stella painting I saw two months ago or present to us, e.g., when I imagine a Frank Stella painting I saw two months ago or house as having a back side even though I am only looking at its front side. However, as we shall see, on Kant's view, the imagination is not confined to representing objects in narrow physical sense; rather he takes the imagination to also be able to produce representations of objects that are not present in virtue of being intellectual objects, e.g. concepts and ideas.  This happens, for example, in make-believe when a child sees a stick a wand, in fiction when I picture what Natasha from War and Peace looks like, or in mental imagery when I imagine the paragon of moral virtue."
      
      *Så indbildningskraften er involveret i hvad vi vil kalde fantasi, perception, hukommelse, metaforik -- alle de steder hvor noget ikke sanseligt re-præsenteres -- men hvorfor er der tale om en re-præsentation og ikke en præsentation? Er der i alle tilfælde tale om noget præsenteres igen eller bare præsenteres? *

      "On a Kantian analysis, in each cases, the imagination plays a pivotal role because it brings something nonsensible, e.g., the absent Stella painting, the unseen back side of the house, the wand, Natasha, or virtue, to bear on our sensible representations. What this line of thought ultimately points to is Kant's idea that the imagination is fundamentally a capacity for producing representations that bridge the gap between what is sensible, on the one hand, and what is insensible or intellectual, on the other, and this mediating activity is one Kant takes to be crucial for our cognitive, aesthetic, and moral experience."
